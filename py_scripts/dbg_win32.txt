Start the MinGW Shell

You can paste stuff into the shell with Shift + Insert

Put Python on the path, if necessary (does python --version work?):

export PATH=/c/Python27:/c/Python27/Scripts:$PATH

If built from the Eclipse IDE, just issue
 
  sg2ps_runner.py

from the py_scripts directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------

If that did not work, then:

Apparently, we have to put gdb on the path too:

export PATH=$PATH:/c/MinGW/bin/

cd into the source directory of sg2ps, where the cpp files are

Then compile:
g++ -O0 -ggdb3 -DDONT_CATCH *.cpp -o sg2ps.exe 

Move the sg2ps.exe into the Debug subdirectory

mv sg2ps.exe  ./Debug/

cd into the py_scripts

cd py_scripts/

Start the etalon tests:

./sg2ps_runner.py
